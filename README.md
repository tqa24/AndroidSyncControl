Android Sync Control is a lightweight Windows desktop app that mirrors and controls many
Android devices simultaneously. Tick **Sync** on the main device and every touch and key
press is forwarded to all the other devices at the same time — do it once, run it everywhere.
Built on top of [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy).

## Features

- **Synchronized control** — Enable **Sync** on the main device and every tap and
  keystroke is mirrored to all connected devices at once.
- **Multi-device mirroring** — Display and control many phones side by side in a grid.
  Devices are auto-detected through ADB and can be added or removed on the fly.
- **Audio to PC speakers** — Hear the audio from a device straight through your PC speakers
  (XAudio2). Mute/unmute each device individually without dropping the connection.
- **GPU acceleration** — Hardware video decoding via Direct3D 11 (D3D11VA) for smooth,
  low-CPU mirroring. Tune the max FPS and max resolution to balance quality and load.
- **Auto-reconnect** — If a device reboots or drops, the app waits for it to come back and
  reconnects automatically — no manual steps.
- **Light / Dark theme** — Three modes: follow system, Light, or Dark. Keeps the device
  screen awake and shows touches.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (**x64**)
- An Android device with **USB debugging** enabled (Developer options)
- USB connection (or ADB over Wi‑Fi). ADB is bundled with the app.

## Download

Grab the latest build from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/tqk2811/AndroidSyncControl/releases)
page (`AndroidSyncControl-<version>-net8.0-windows.zip`). No installation required — unzip and run
`AndroidSyncControl.exe`.

## Usage

1. On the phone, enable **Developer options → USB debugging**, then connect it via USB and
   accept the debugging prompt.
2. Launch `AndroidSyncControl.exe`. Connected devices appear in the **Device** dropdown.
3. Pick a device and choose how to show it:
   - **Show Main** — put the selected device in the large main panel (fully controllable).
   - **Show ListView** — add the selected device to the grid on the right.
   - **Show All in ListView** — add every detected device to the grid at once.
4. Tick **Sync** on the main device to control all grid devices simultaneously.
5. Adjust the toolbar to taste.

### Toolbar reference

| Control | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Size** | Scale of the device previews (1–100%). |
| **MaxFps** | Caps the video frame rate (1–120). Applied on the next connection. |
| **MaxSize** | Caps the longest video edge in pixels (multiple of 8). Below 360 = native size. Applied on reconnect. |
| **GPU** | On: hardware decode via D3D11VA. Off: CPU decode. Applied on reconnect. |
| **Audio** | On: receive & decode the device audio stream. Applied on reconnect. |
| **Sync** | Forward the main device's input to all other devices (main panel only). |
| **Speaker** | Play that device's audio through the PC speakers (per device). |
| **Disconnect** | Disconnect that device. |
